    blogDate: 'Nov 04, 2023',
    blogDetail:
      'Netflix Eureka is a Java-based open source project that provides a RESTful interface for service discovery and registration. It consists of two main components: Eureka Server and Eureka Client. Eureka Server is a centralized registry that maintains a list of all the registered services and their instances. Eureka Client is a library that interacts with the Eureka Server to register, deregister, and discover other services. Eureka Client also provides a client-side load balancer that can route requests to the best available service instance.',

    blogDetail:
      'Reactive Programming is an important coding style that evolved from the functional world. Reactive code utilizes an event-driven philosophy of streams, producers, and subscribers to simplify complex logic and enable asynchronous, nonblocking handling of IO processing in applications. In Java, this means we can build applications using the java.nio (nonblocking IO) package with expressive APIs. Many frameworks and approaches support reactivity in Java. One of the most popular is Spring WebFlux. This article is a hands-on introduction to reactive Java programming with Spring WebFlux',

      'Spring AOP Logging',
    subHeading:
      'AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does this by adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself.',
    blogDate: 'Oct 31, 2022',
    blogDetail:
      'AOP is referred to as a tool for implementing cross-cutting concerns. The term crosscutting concerns refers to logic in an application that cannot be decomposed from the rest of the application and may result in code duplication and tight coupling. By using AOP for modularizing individual pieces of logic, known as concerns, you can apply them to many parts of an application without duplicating the code or creating hard dependencies.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Logging and security are typical examples of crosscutting concerns that are present in many applications. You often need to log actions or check if someone has permission in many parts of your program. AOP helps you do this without writing the same code all over the place.',

      'When it comes to event-driven microservice architecture Apache Kafka® is by far the most popular tool for event-driven microservices, whether it’s self-managed as an open source tool or uses the richer feature-set available on Confluent. Kafka blends together concepts seen in traditional messaging systems, Big Data infrastructure, and traditional databases and Confluent expands on this with an online platform with better scalability, infinite storage, and event streaming features such as data lineage, schemas, and advanced security.',

    blogDetail:
      'RabbitMQ is a widely used open-source message broker that helps in scaling the application by deploying a message queuing mechanism in between the two applications. It offers temporary storage for data preventing data loss. RabbitMQ Queue takes messages from the publisher and sends them to the consumer.',

    subHeading:
      'The WebSocket protocol, RFC 6455, provides a standardized way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel between client and server over a single TCP connection. It is a different TCP protocol from HTTP but is designed to work over HTTP, using ports 80 and 443 and allowing re-use of existing firewall rules.',
    blogDate: 'May 23, 2022',
    blogDetail:
      'WebSockets can make a web page be dynamic and interactive. However, in many cases, a combination of AJAX and HTTP streaming or long polling can provide a simple and effective solution.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For example, news, mail, and social feeds need to update dynamically, but it may be perfectly okay to do so every few minutes. Collaboration, games, and financial apps, on the other hand, need to be much closer to real-time.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Latency alone is not a deciding factor. If the volume of messages is relatively low (for example, monitoring network failures) HTTP streaming or polling can provide an effective solution. It is the combination of low latency, high frequency, and high volume that make the best case for the use of WebSocket',

    blogDetail:
      'Spring Data JPA aims to significantly improve the implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount that’s actually needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces using any number of techniques, and Spring will wire it up for you automatically. You can even use custom finders or query by example and Spring will write the query for you!',
